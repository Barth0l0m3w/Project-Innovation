# Project Innovation

In the 3rd term 2nd-year Creative Media and Game Technologies project, my team and I developed a Unity multiplayer game that utilizes input from multiple devices. The objective of the project was to create a Unity project that combines different elements.

Our game is inspired by the concept of Escaperoom and incorporates a dark fantasy theme. It revolves around the characters Hansel and Gretel, who must work together to escape from Babajaga and avoid being eaten.

As one of the engineers on the project, my main focus was on the gameplay aspect. I designed and implemented multiple mini-games, ensuring that all the art assets were properly integrated into the game. Additionally, I created a camera rig system that allowed players to pan between different cameras and explore their environment.

One of the aspects I am particularly proud of is the integration of mobile device functions into the game. We used the gyroscope functionality to angle the lock for the pick-locking mini-game. The microphone was used to detect the player blowing on the dust-covered posters to unlock clues. Lastly, the touchscreen functionality enabled players to navigate through various rooms.
